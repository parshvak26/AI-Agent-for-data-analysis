This project is a simple AI-powered data analysis tool designed for quick insights on CSV or Excel files. You provide the data, and the agent handles the rest.

## What It Does

- Accepts data in **CSV** or **Excel** format  
- Generates a clear summary of the dataset  
- Identifies patterns, trends and basic statistical insights  
- Suggests sample questions you can ask about the data  
- Allows you to ask your own custom questions  
- Can generate **SQL queries** based on the contents of your file

## Example Questions You Can Ask

- “What are the most important columns in this dataset?”  
- “Are there any correlations?”  
- “Give me a summary of the top categories.”  
- “Write an SQL query to filter records based on a condition.”

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal, beginner-friendly AI agent that makes data exploration easier without needing complex setup or advanced machine-learning knowledge.
